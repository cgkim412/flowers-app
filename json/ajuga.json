    "meaning": "The genus name was derived from the Latin word “Abija”, which might have been a variant of the term “abigo” meaning “to drive away”. The name refers to the medicinal properties of the plant. The scientific name of this plant is Ajuga, but it’s also known as “Bugleweed” because its flowers look like bugles. This common name usually refers to Ajuga reptans, though it may also be applied to the whole genus.",
