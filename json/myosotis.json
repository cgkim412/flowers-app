Its common name “Forget Me Not” is derived from the French “ne m’oubliez pas” and there are many legends regarding the name “Forget-me-not”.The legend says that during medieval times, a knight and his lady were walking beside a river. He picked a posy of flowers for her, but his heavy armor caused him to lose his balance and he fell into the river. As he was drowning, he threw her the posy of flowers and shouted out “Forget me not”.According to a German legend, when God was naming all the flowers, this flower was the last, unnamed plant. Tiny, unnamed flower cried out, “Forget-me-not, O Lord!” and God said, “That shall be your name!”.", "symbols": ["Death", "Hope", "Love", "Remembrance"], "color_description": "The flowers are usually blue, but may be pink or white, sometimes with a yellow center.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "white", "yellow"]}
