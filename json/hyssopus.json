However, a recent source suggests that the biblical ezov was a common term for certain plants belonging to the genus Origanum. The plant is also known as Hyssop, although it is a widely recognized common name for the particular species – Hyssopus officinalis.It’s worth to mention that there are several plants that are referred to as Hyssop. For example, Agastache foeniculum is commonly known as Anise Hyssop. This plant is also a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae), but despite the common name it is not botanically related to Hyssopus.", "symbols": ["Health", "Modesty", "Protection", "Sacrifice"], "color_description": "The flowers are usually purple and blue, or rarely pink and white.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "purple", "white"]}
