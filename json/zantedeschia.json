The plant is commonly known as “Calla Lily”. The name, which comes from the Greek word “calla” (“beautiful”), is actually a misnomer because the plant is not a true lily. Carolus Linnaeus, a famous Swedish botanist, made an error naming the plant. But despite the fact it was corrected later, the common name is still in use and relevant today.", "symbols": ["Beauty", "Death", "Faithfulness", "Purity", "Rebirth"], "color_description": "Calla Lily is available in a multitude of colors including white, yellow, orange, pink, purple and even black.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Summer"], "colors": ["black", "orange", "pink", "purple", "white", "yellow"]}
