Chiron was a centaur known for his knowledge of medicine. He used the Centaurea flower to heal his wounds. Chiron is credited with teaching mankind about the medical secrets and healing power of herbs. The name “Cornflower” is given because the plant often grows in cornfields. The common name “Bachelor’s Button” has several possible origins.English girls wore them to show they were eligible to marry. It was thought that if a girl hid the flower under her apron, she could have the bachelor of her choice.The flowers were also worn by young men in love when they liked someone and wanted to date them.Some believe the common name was given because the bud resembles a kind of button that required no sewing. The common names “Cornflower”, “Bachelor’s Button” and “Basket Flower” are used for the entire genus but most often refers to the species Centaurea cyanus.", "symbols": ["Anticipation", "Devotion", "Fertility", "Hope", "Love", "Remembrance", "Wealth"], "color_description": "The flowers are traditionally blue in color but are also available in purple, pink, yellow and white.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "purple", "white", "yellow"]}
