{"name": "Borago", "alt_names": ["Borage"], "description": "Borago, also known as Borage is a genus of five species in the family Boraginaceae, native to the Mediterranean region.These plants usually have long stalks, alternate leaves and attractive star-shaped or bell-shaped flowers. The nectar of the flowers is extremely attractive to bees, so expect to hear the gentle, but audible sound of bees buzzing among them when they are in bloom. They are great for beds, borders and herb gardens.", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/799px-Borage_Borago_officinalis-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/449px-Borago_officinalis_flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Borago_officinalis_blue_blossom-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/800px-Borago_pygmaea_in_Dunedin_Botanic_Garden-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/borage-3560211_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/600px-Borago_officinalis-IMG_4345-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/borage-494636_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6109524_f808140e_1024x1024-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "The origin of the genus name is not as clear. Linnaeus, the father of biological nomenclature, stated that the name was a corruption of “corago”, from the Latin words “cor”, meaning “heart”, and “ago”, which means “to act”, due to its medicinal value in treating heart conditions.Some believe the name may also derive from the Latin word “burra”, which means “hairy garment”, because of the hairiness of the plant.", "symbols": ["Courage", "Power"], "color_description": "The flowers are mostly blue in color, but can also be pink.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink"]}
