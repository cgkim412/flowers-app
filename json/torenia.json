The common name “Wishbone Flower” comes from the two stamens united at the anthers, forming a structure that resembles a chicken wishbone. The common name “Bluewings” refers to its wing-shaped petals. These brightly colored flowers also resemble a face of a clown, hence the common name “Clown Flower”. This is especially true with the pink, yellow and white varieties.", "symbols": ["Charm", "Happiness"], "color_description": "The flowers come in shades of purple, blue, pink, yellow and white.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "purple", "white", "yellow"]}
