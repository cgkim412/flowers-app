He could change his shape at will, just like Proteas that come in a variety of stunning shapes and colors. In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the god of the sea, earthquakes and horses. His son, Proteus, had the tendency to often change his shape and appearance in order to avoid detection and to deter people from finding him. He could change his shape whenever he wanted, hence the name given to these flowers as they come in a variety of stunning shapes, sizes and colors.", "symbols": ["Courage", "Ingenuity"], "color_description": "These flowers come in shades of white, purple, red, orange, yellow and green.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Winter", "Summer"], "colors": ["green", "orange", "purple", "red", "white", "yellow"]}
