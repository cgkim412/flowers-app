{"name": "Eranthis", "alt_names": ["Winter Aconite"], "description": "Eranthis is a genus of about 10 species of tuberous perennials in the family Ranunculaceae, native to southern Europe and Asia.These low-growing plants are among the most striking winter flowers and one of the earliest bulbs to bloom in spring, often appearing alongside Snowdrops. The cup-shaped flowers are yellow or white, distinct and quite unusual, supported by divided leafy bracts. They are easy to maintain and can survive snow and frost. These early-bloomers are great for beds and borders, and will look beautiful planted in large drifts under trees. They are suitable for rock gardens, cottage gardens and as a groundcover.", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275020_1280-700x500.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275024_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275065_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flowers-88548_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-1025046_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275076_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-95992_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275036_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-275025_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-1025057_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winterling-1025073_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winter-linge-318811_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/winter-linge-273953_1280-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "The genus name comes from the Greek words “er”, meaning “spring” and “anthos”, which means “flower”, in reference to the early-blooming nature of this plant.
