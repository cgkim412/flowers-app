Its common name “Witch Hazel” is partly due to the resemblance of its leaves to the common hazel and partly from the Middle English “wiche” (from the Old English “wice”), meaning “pliant” or “bendable” and relates to its twigs and young branches.", "symbols": ["Protection"], "color_description": "Hamamelis flowers range in color from deep red to yellow.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Winter"], "colors": ["red", "yellow"]}
