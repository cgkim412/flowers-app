The most popular member of the genus is Calendula officinalis, also known as Pot Marigold.Calendulas are admired by gardeners for their cheerful, daisy-like, bright orange and yellow flowers. Blooms may be single or double and are made of tiny disk and ray florets. The simple leaves are borne alternately along the waxy, smooth, or glandular stems.
