This plant is scientifically known as Aconitum, but it has many common names such as “Aconite”, “Monkshood” and “Wolfsbane”. “Aconite” is the English form of its Greek and Latin name. The shepherds in ancient Greece laced bait and arrows with Aconite to kill wolves, hence the other common name “Wolfsbane”. The common name “Monkshood” was given because the top of the blossom resembles the monastic head covering.", "symbols": ["Caution", "Death"], "color_description": "The flowers come in shades of blue, purple, white, yellow, or even pink.", "seasons": ["Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "purple", "white", "yellow"]}
