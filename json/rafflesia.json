{"name": "Rafflesia", "alt_names": [], "description": "Rafflesia is a genus of about 20 species of parasitic flowering plants in the family Rafflesiaceae, native to tropical rain forest areas of Southeast Asia.Rafflesia is one of the biggest and one of the stinkiest flower in the world. It has five huge leathery petals, with a central disc in the middle surrounded by a diaphragm. This plant is bizarre, spectacular and rare, with no leaves, no roots and no stem. It doesn’t have chlorophyll and therefore is incapable of photosynthesis, causing some to argue that Rafflesia isn’t a flower at all.", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rafflesia_Borneo_7041538201-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Poring_Sabah_-_Rafflesia-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/11967407133_3d6ad4abc4_k-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/8299051599_93489067d1_b-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/8299051599_3fb66fe89d_o-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rafflesia_arnoldi_2013-12-31_21-48-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "The genus name was given in honor of Sir Stamford Raffles (1781-1826), a British statesman and founder of the British colony of Singapore.", "symbols": ["Artifice", "Death", "Temptation"], "color_description": "Rafflesia is reddish brown with white marks on its petals.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Winter", "Summer"], "colors": ["brown", "white"]}
