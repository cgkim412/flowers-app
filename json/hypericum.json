The common name “St. John’s wort” refers to John the Baptist, as the plant blooms around the time of the Feast of St. John the Baptist in late June. The plant was traditionally gathered and burned on midsummer’s eve (June 23), as a protection against evil spirits. This date was later christianized as the eve of the feast day of St. John the Baptist.The term “wort” refers to the old English name for herb or plant.", "symbols": ["Cheerfulness", "Protection", "Rebirth"], "color_description": "The flowers are generally yellow.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["yellow"]}
