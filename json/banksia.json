{"name": "Banksia", "alt_names": ["Australian Honeysuckle"], "description": "Banksia is a genus of about 100 species in the family Proteaceae, native to the Southern Hemisphere. Most are shrubs, but some are robust trees, with diverse foliage and large, complex flower heads.Banksias are known for their distinctive, often large cone-shaped flower spikes. The flower head is made up of hundreds or even thousands of small individual flowers attached to a central axis. The flowers are often honey-scented and nectar-rich. There is no doubt that Banksias are valued as an important food source for a number of animals. They are highly attractive to pollinators and the birds absolutely adore them!", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/450px-Saw_banksia_Banksia_serrata_flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/banksia-3599943_1920-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/banksia-365351_1920-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Banksia_integrifolia_subsp._monticola_flower_8668610626-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Banksia_rosserae_flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Banksia_marginata_mature_flower_8743929412-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/banksia-1688779_1920-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/PIXNIO-17345-725x544-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hairpin_Banksia_flower_8704370158-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/9413986477_e0ba621f92_z-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "Banksia is named after the famous English naturalist and explorer, Sir Joseph Banks (1743-1820), who collected and described these plants on his voyage to Australia with captain James Cook.
