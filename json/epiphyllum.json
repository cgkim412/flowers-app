Like all cacti, Epiphyllums have stems, but no leaves. They are often grown in hanging baskets to accommodate their leaf-like stems, but can also be grown in containers. In the wild, Epiphyllum grows between tree branches and into rock crevices. The genus includes one of the most expensive flowers in the world – Epiphyllum oxypetalum, also known as Kadupul or Queen of the Night.", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/44644180571_eb06144344_z-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Queen_of_the_night_Epiphyllum_oxypetalum_flower_1-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/166240063_b54be19112_z-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Epiphyllum_phyllanthus_in_Blüte-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/41718701391_25a0cfc128_z-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/800px-Epiphyllum-oxypetalum-whitelight-side-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Epiphyllum_King_Midas-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Epiphyllum_oxypetalum_midnight_cactus_flower-2414-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/694px-Epiphyllum_Wendy-2-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Epiphyllum_pumilum_flower_3-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/286970600_ed6b9f8180_z-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/800px-Epiphyllum_anguliger_2007-10-18_flowering_IMG_4642_EDIT-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "The genus name “Epiphyllum” means “upon the leaves”. It comes from the Greek words “epi”, which means “on” or “upon”, and “phyllon” meaning “leaf”, because early botanists considered that the flower came from a leaf, which are actually stems. The plant is also known as “Orchid Cactus” because of the flowers which resemble some orchid species.", "symbols": ["Admiration", "Patience", "Spirituality"], "color_description": "The flowers are usually white, sometimes with yellow or pink sepals. However, most Epiphyllums grown today are hybrids and may be red, purple, pink, orange and yellow.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Summer"], "colors": ["orange", "pink", "purple", "red", "white", "yellow"]}
