According to Christian tradition, Veronica was one of the holy women who accompanied Jesus Christ to Calvary. She offered him a towel or veil to wipe his face to relieve his suffering on the road to Calvary, and the image of Christ’s face was imprinted on it when he died. The common name “Speedwell” refers to the plant’s supposed medicinal properties to support a quick return to health.", "symbols": ["Devotion", "Faithfulness", "Fidelity", "Love", "Loyalty"], "color_description": "Veronica comes in shades of blue, purple, pink and white.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["blue", "pink", "purple", "white"]}
