    "description": "Anthurium is a large genus of about 1000 species in the family Araceae, native to the tropical regions of the Americas.Anthurium has large, lance-shaped or heart-shaped leaves and brightly colored, heart-shaped flower bracts. The spathe, which everyone calls a flower, is just a modified leaf. Its function is to protect the flowers. The real flowers are actually many tiny flowers growing along the spadix, arising from the base of the spathe. Anthurium is popular among flower lovers because of its bright colors, unusual appearance and lasting qualities of flowers.",
