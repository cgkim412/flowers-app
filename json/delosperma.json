The capsule has no covering membrane and the seeds are exposed when the capsule opens. The plants are not called an Ice Plants because they are cold hardy. The common name probably comes from the little hairs on its stems, which reflect light, glistening in the sun like ice.Ice plant is a common name used for several similar genera of flowering plants including Delosperma, Mesembryanthemum, Carpobrotus, Conicosia, and the monotypic Disphyma.", "symbols": ["Good fortune"], "color_description": "Delosperma comes in many colors including red, purple, orange, pink, yellow and white.", "seasons": ["Spring", "Autumn", "Summer"], "colors": ["orange", "pink", "purple", "red", "white", "yellow"]}
