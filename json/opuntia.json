{"name": "Opuntia", "alt_names": ["Prickly Pear"], "description": "Opuntia is a genus of about 200 species in the cactus family (Cactaceae), native to North and South America, from Canada to Argentina.Opuntias have a unique shape and structure. The green segments are not leaves, but swollen water-storing stem segments – cladodes. The flat surfaces of these cladodes are covered with areoles that have tiny spines called glochids. Evolutionarily speaking, the leaves are modified into spines to protect a plant against predators. The flowers are usually cup-shaped and yellow in color. Opuntias are attractive, easy to grow and excellent for any garden. They are one of the most beautiful plants in the cactus world!", "img_urls": ["https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/18331290285_88f24dd7c1_c-700x500.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Opuntia_Flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Opuntia_basilaris_flower_2-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cactus_Opuntia_phaeacantha_flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/26659830816_12f9c5decf_c-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/41166308410_e4c9493d0b_c-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Opuntia_humifusa_flower-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/12525713513_2ae93a1048_c-150x150.jpg", "https://www.atozflowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Opuntia_robusta_Wheel_Cactus_ოპუნცია_2-150x150.jpg"], "meaning": "The genus was named after the Ancient Greek city of Opus, one of the oldest towns in Greece where it is said that a cactus-like plant grew.
